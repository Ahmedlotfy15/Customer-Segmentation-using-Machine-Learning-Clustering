## **Project Description**
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern marketing, allowing businesses to understand and target their customers effectively.  
This project uses a dataset of customer data, cleans it, and applies clustering models to identify distinct customer groups.  
The primary goals of this project include:
- Identifying clusters of customers based on their behavior.
- Creating visualizations to interpret the clusters.
- Providing actionable insights for marketing campaigns.

## **Features**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution and boxplots for feature understanding.
  - Correlation analysis via heatmaps.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Generating dummy variables for categorical features.
  - Standardizing numerical features for clustering.
- **Clustering Models**:
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Visualized with a dendrogram.
  - **K-means Clustering**: Optimal cluster determination using the Elbow Method.
- **Segmentation Visualization**:
  - Scatter plots to display customer groups.
  - Cluster profiles for better interpretation.
